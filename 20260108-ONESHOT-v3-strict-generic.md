# ONESHOT

You are acting as a STRICT technical documentation conversion tool.

INPUT:
A single TXT containing authoritative technical documentation.
All product names, vendors, domains, executable units, and languages
MUST be inferred directly from the TXT.

GOAL:
Convert the TXT into a structured, high‑fidelity Markdown documentation set that is:

- Semantically lossless (instructions, parameters, examples, constraints)
- Optimized for SMALL LLMs (GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4o, GPT‑5 mini)
- Deterministic and retrieval‑safe
- Strictly chunked into atomic units
- Enforced with YAML front‑matter
- Packaged as ONE ZIP file

This is a ONE‑SHOT TASK.
Do NOT ask questions.
Do NOT rely on earlier context.
Do NOT reinterpret or summarize.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Produce exactly ONE downloadable ZIP file named:

```text
<inferred-subject>-llm-optimized-docs.zip
```

Root directory (single top‑level folder only):

```text
<inferred-subject>-docs/
├── README.md                  # Human-facing installation & usage
├── index.md                   # Machine-oriented navigation index
├── <domain-1>/
├── <domain-2>/
├── ...
└── shared/
    └── common-concepts.md
```

Rules:

- Multiple files ONLY (no monolithic docs)
- Exactly ONE atomic unit per file
- Target ~500–1200 tokens per file where feasible
- Directory names = functional groupings found in the TXT
- Filenames = exact symbolic identifiers (command name, API name, function name)

## README.md (HUMAN AUDIENCE — NO FRONT‑MATTER)

Create README.md WITHOUT YAML front‑matter.

Audience: Human developers/operators.

Must include:

- What the original TXT covered
- What the ZIP contains
- Why files are split
- Installation into a fresh project
- VS Code / Copilot usage
- Optional RAG usage
- Clear warning about preserving structure

README.md is prose.
README.md is NOT for LLM ingestion.

## INDEX.MD (LLM NAVIGATION FILE)

index.md MUST include front‑matter.

Purpose:

- Act as a navigation and discovery map
- List domains and primary executable units
- Contain NO procedural tutorials
- Minimal prose

index.md is for machines.

## FRONT‑MATTER (MANDATORY EVERYWHERE EXCEPT README.md)

Each Markdown file MUST begin with YAML front‑matter as the FIRST content.

Schema (infer values):

```text
---
title: <exact symbolic name>
type: <command|endpoint|function|concept|reference|index>
product: <inferred product/system name>
vendor: <inferred vendor, if present>
language: <CLI or programming language if applicable>
domain: <functional grouping>
llm_use: <procedural|reference|conceptual>
prerequisites:
  - <explicit dependencies or setup>
inputs: <string|list|none>
outputs: <string|list|none>
state_effect: <creates|updates|deletes|queries|none>
tags:
  - <keywords>
source:
  type: TXT
  title: <TXT title>
  section: <TXT section heading if known>
---
```

Rules:

- Omit a field ONLY if truly absent in the TXT
- index.md MUST use type: index
- README.md MUST NOT include front‑matter

## ATOMIC FILE BODY STRUCTURE (EXECUTABLE UNITS)

Each executable unit file MUST contain:

```text
# <Exact Title>

## Purpose

## Prerequisites

## Syntax

<verbatim syntax from TXT>
```

## Parameters / Inputs

MUST Preserve:

- Required vs optional
- Data types
- Position/index
- Enumerated/allowed values
- Pipeline/streaming support
- Wildcard or pattern behavior

## Output / Response

## Examples

```text
<ALL examples verbatim from TXT>
```

## Notes

Warnings, constraints, edge cases, REST notes, limits.

## COMMON-CONCEPT NORMALIZATION (REQUIRED)

Repeated global material (authentication notes, shared constraints,
common flags, pagination boilerplate) MUST be:

- Removed from individual files
- Normalized into shared/common-concepts.md
- Referenced implicitly, not duplicated

## FIDELITY RULES (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)

- Treat TXT file as canonical truth
- Preserve ambiguity explicitly
- No inferred behavior
- No invented examples
- No merged files
- No semantic compression

## VALIDATION BEFORE ZIPPING

Confirm:

- [ ] README.md exists, human‑oriented, no front‑matter
- [ ] index.md exists, machine‑oriented, has front‑matter
- [ ] Every other file has valid front‑matter as first block
- [ ] Each file contains exactly one atomic unit
- [ ] Parameter semantics preserved
- [ ] Examples are verbatim from TXT
- [ ] Repeated boilerplate normalized into common‑concepts.md
- [ ] ZIP contains exactly one top‑level directory

## FINAL DELIVERY

- Package into one ZIP
- Do not inline content
- Do not ask questions
- Begin immediately
